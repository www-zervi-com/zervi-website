# PWA Icons for Zervi Website

This directory should contain the following icon files for Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality:

## Required Icon Files

1. `favicon.ico` - 16x16, 32x32 (multi-size ICO file)
2. `icon-72x72.png` - 72x72 PNG
3. `icon-96x96.png` - 96x96 PNG
4. `icon-128x128.png` - 128x128 PNG
5. `icon-144x144.png` - 144x144 PNG
6. `icon-152x152.png` - 152x152 PNG
7. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 PNG
8. `icon-384x384.png` - 384x384 PNG
9. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 PNG

## Icon Guidelines

- All icons should be square with the Zervi logo centered
- Use the primary brand color (#005f87) as the background
- Ensure the logo has enough padding (approximately 15% on each side)
- Save as PNG format with transparency where appropriate
- The favicon.ico should be created as a multi-size ICO file containing both 16x16 and 32x32 versions

## How to Create These Icons

1. Start with a high-resolution version of the Zervi logo
2. Create a 512x512 master version with proper padding and background
3. Resize this master version to create all the other required sizes
4. For favicon.ico, use a tool like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

## Testing

After adding these icons, test the PWA functionality by:

1. Opening the website in Chrome
2. Opening Developer Tools (F12)
3. Going to the "Application" tab
4. Selecting "Manifest" in the sidebar
5. Verifying that all icons are properly loaded

## Note

These icons are required for the website to function properly as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and for proper display when users add the website to their home screen on mobile devices.
